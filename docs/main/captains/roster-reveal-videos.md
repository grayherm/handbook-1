### Do it yourself

Definitely the most time consuming option, but also the most rewarding. You'll need to have some basic video editing skills, and a lot of patience. You'll also need to be able to get your team together to record some footage, and you'll need to be able to get some footage from previous matches.

We recommend using the following software:

- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) for recording footage
- [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) for editing the video
- [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) for creating animated graphics (this costs money)

You are free to use any software you like, but these are the ones we recommend.

You are also free to use your team's shared Google Drive. If you don't have one yet, you can create one by asking management to create one for you.

Keep in mind that any video you submit to management will be immediately dedicated to the public domain. This means that anyone can use it for any purpose, including commercial purposes.

Additionally, any videos created must be 1080p including player clips at minimum. 2k and 4k are perfect as well :). 

Once you've finished editing your video, you can submit it to management by simply sending them a link to the video file on the team's shared Google Drive.
